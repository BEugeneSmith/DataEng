Some ways I would've wanted to expand these tests-

In the two small tests I built I wanted to test on of the ways I initially interacted with the Uptake site. If I were to expand this further I would explore some links to external sites, like through the Newsroom to test how that is linked up to the site. Scrolling interactions also seemed like something good to expand the tests to as there is much of that built into the Uptake site.

There aren't any tests for failure, but those would be good to test the contact page.
